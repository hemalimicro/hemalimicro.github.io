# Amazon AWS Interview Experience 
It takes 28 days of hard work only to adopt a behavioural change then guess what would be the time that it takes to crack a dream job? The answer would differ based on what your dream job is. Everyone dreams of working for an MNC. I am one of them too and in this blog post, I’m going to share my interview experience with Amazon AWS for the Cloud Support Associate role. My College CMR Institute of Technology, Hyderabad was the cornerstone for the whole process as it was an On-campus drive. It was in the month of August When AWS visited our campus. There was a total of 4 rounds each being an elimination round. The first round was an Online Assessment and was open to all. Everyone was allowed to appear for the first round, and around 350-400 students took the test. 
## Round 1(Online Assessment): 
Round 1, as already mentioned was a written test. It consisted of 4 sections. None of them was a timed section and it would take approximately 80-90 mins to complete the test. 1st section was a **Work Simulation** in which we were asked to work through scenarios that were commonly experienced by AWS Support Engineers. Our task as support engineers was to effectively respond to the situations of the customers and rank the effectiveness of various measures we would take to respond to such scenarios. 2nd section dealt with **Technical Knowledge** where we were asked to answer questions based on AWS and other technical concepts like Operating Systems and Computer Networks. It was an MCQ-based section, and each question was provided with multiple options. Both these sections consumed most of the time in the test. The other 3 sections were based on the individual’s personality assessment. 3rd section was about **Work preferences and skills** which were based on our sense of work and technical proficiency. We were given a list of topics like Networking, Databases, Deployment, Backend Support, Data Analytics, etc., and were asked about our expertise in them and what topic interests us the most. Followed by the 4th section **Amazon Workstyles** which consisted of questions that accessed our qualities based on the responses of 5 points Likert scale. At the last, there was a Feedback survey where we were asked to give feedback about the assessment. The first 3 sections are to be focused much to clear the Online Assessment.
Almost after a month or so results were announced and there were 6 members who got through the online assessment, and I was one of them. The next Round was the Interview Round which was divided into 3 rounds. All the 3 rounds were knockout rounds and were scheduled on the same day. 
## Round 2(Technical Interview Round 1): 
Round 2 was a Technical Interview which was a video call via Amazon Chime. Basically, we had two technical rounds and 1 managerial and behavioural round. This round was mostly focused on the concepts of Operating systems and troubleshooting scenarios related to them. It took around an hour to complete the interview.
My interviewer was very supportive and tried to make me comfortable before we started. First, he asked me to introduce myself and asked me to choose between Windows or Linux. I preferred to choose Linux. The questions were as follows:
1.	Booting Process in Detail.
2.	Booting Process troubleshooting.
3.	Bootable Device not found. Troubleshoot it.
4.	Common Linux commands and their use.
5.	Device is slowing down. What can be the reasons and how to troubleshoot it.
6.	How to check for Disk Free space.
7.	Commands to check for CPU Utilization.
8.	Disk space is available, but the file is not getting created. Why?
9.	What are inodes and their importance.
10.	What is a process?
11.	What is a Deadlock and conditions for it?
12.	CPU scheduling algorithms.
13.	Memory Management Techniques.
14.	Paging Concept.
15.	Virtual Memory.
16.	Page replacement techniques.
17.	Disk Scheduling algorithms and terms related to Disk.
Almost all the major topics of Operating systems were covered and in the last 10-15 mins I was asked to solve a coding problem. I was given an array of numbers that indicated the number of floors in each building. If sun rays were perpendicular to these buildings, then I was asked to find out the building on which sun rays would fall first. 
I used the maximum till n approach in solving this question.
With this, my first round of Interviews came to an end, and I got qualified for the next technical interview.

## Round 3(Technical Interview Round 2):                
This round like the previous round was a video call via Amazon Chime. As most of the Operating Systems were covered in the last round, this round was mostly focused on Computer Networks and their troubleshooting scenarios. This round lasted for an hour. It started with a self-introduction and went on with the questions as follows:
1.	Explain DHCP and DORA processes in detail.
2.	What happens if www.amazon.com or any website name is clicked? I was asked to explain this in detail.
3.	Explain the layers of the OSI Model. Questions related to layers.
4.	All 0’s in the IP address indicates what?
5.	SSL Handshake in detail.
6.	Difference between SSL and TCL and their real-life applications.
7.	DNS Query process.
8.	How do you check which ports are listening?
9.	Troubleshooting slow server.
10.	How do PING and TRACEROUTE commands work?
11.	Packet Tracing.
12.	How DNS works in detail?
These were the questions that were asked in Round 3 and my interviewer gave me a chance to ask questions if I had any.
## Round 4(Managerial and Human Resource (HR) Round):
Immediately after the 3rd round, I was informed to join in for the last round. It was also a video call via Amazon Chime. As it was a hectic day, the interviewer tried to make me comfortable before we began with the round.
1.	Introduce Yourself.
2.	Detailed discussion about projects.
3.	My role as a Team Leader in my project.
4.	How did I manage my team?
5.	Tell me about a time you did something out of your comfort zone.
6.	Tell me about a time when you had to take critical feedback.
7.	Asked me about my interests in competitive programming.
8.	Did you ever ask your peers for help when you were stuck?
9.	How did you develop an interest in Competitive Programming.
10.	How often do you help your peers?
11.	Tell me a situation where you had to take a decision on the spot.
12.	How comfortable are you with learning new concepts?
13.	Any Questions for me?
This was the whole process I went through during my Amazon AWS interviews. After waiting for around 2 months, I received the results from my Training and placement team. Unfortunately, I was rejected, and it was devastating for me to handle it. Then I thought of sharing my experiences which could help many who are interested in the Cloud Support Associate role. It was a great experience, getting interviewed by such a tech giant like Amazon AWS.
